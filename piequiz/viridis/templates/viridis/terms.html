  <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
<p>By creating an account, you agree to three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>That you will only post quizzes which you wrote yourself and that you have the legal right to release under these terms.</li>

  <li>That you grant any third party who sees the quiz you post a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to copy and distribute that quiz and, or its questions and answers, and to make and distribute derivative works based on that quiz. You may include license terms in quizzes you post, if you wish to use a particular license (such as the Creative Commons licence), but that license must permit royalty-free copying, distribution and modification of the quiz to which it is applied.</li>

  <li>That if you post a quiz of which you are not the author or for which you do not have the legal right to distribute according to these terms, you will indemnify and hold harmless the operators of this site and any third parties who are exposed to liability as a result of your actions.</li>
</ul>
